Today, I implement Posting System.

In the beginning, I made Logout.
This will clear the local storage, and go back to sign up page.

Then I implemted the code for get the data from database.

There are some difference in the code.
I need to get the data from localStorage's data; otherwise it will return null.

After that, implemnt the html to show the postings from the database.
